# Random Forest based QSAR model to target receptor FLT1 for treatment of Rheumatiod Arthritis

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder that affects roughly 1% of the population worldwide, and is characterized by severe pain due to inflammation of the joints. Despite the painful nature of this disease, there is no specific cure to it. Current treatment options provide symptomatic relief, but do cause adverse effects in patients who consume them. Though it has been proved that medicinal plant metabolites have implications in the treatment of RA, most of the existing studies do not provide the mechanism of action of these potential drug candidates. This project was conducted with the aim of exploring medicinal plants as an alternative treatment for RA. To achieve this, the medicinal plant Rhododendron tomentosum was chosen, and metabolites present in this plant with anti-inflammatory activity were selected. The VEGF pathway, particularly the FLT1 receptor was chosen as the drug target. The primary objectives of this project were to build a QSAR model to predict pIC50 values, perform ADME analysis of the top 10 metabolites was carried out using SwissADME, carry out toxicity studies using ADMETlab and perform molecular docking using AutoDock and visualise DTI using LigPlot+.

The jupyter notebook provides a step by step instruction of how we obtained the data, generated features for the data and built the QSAR model.
